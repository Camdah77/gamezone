  ## UX

### Site Purpose:
Welcome to Art of memory. This is my second project as a student at Code Institute to "Full Stack Software Development-diploma". The project includes the languages JavaScript, HTML and CSS. 
The art are made by myself and while working with the project I realized that this kind of game is saleable to artists and photographers who want to increase the value on their websites instead of just having a clean webshop. 
Anyway, MY purpose of the this page is to challenge the user´s memory in a playful and colorful way.

The site is responsive across all screen sizes.

### Site Goal:
I have used my skills in JavaScript, CSS and HTML and created a simple and fun game. 
The goal is to engage user so they return to the site. 

### Audience:
The audience can be all ages. My kids, 13 and 15 years old found it fun and challengeing as a contrast to today's fast games with lots of graphics and high tempo. The artwork can be changed to fit to suit specific target groups.

### Communication:
The game has a big button to start the game. If the user want to quit before all cards are matched the gameboard has a stop-buttom then you arrive to the welcomepage. 
### Current User Goals:

### New User Goals:
New users compete against themself and hopefully will come back. I hope the users find it relaxing with the colorful. 
### Future Goals:
The game can be a part of a an artist´s webshop to get more interactions with the users. 
It can also have a Top 10 list and the artwork can be exchanged frequently. 
## Design

### Wireframes:

Wireframes are made start to help me with the layout of the welcomescreen and gamearea. 
I also made a overwiew "mindmap" over the javascript functions so I know what step I have to take to get a functional game. That mindmap is also attatched in below.

### Colour Scheme:
Since the artworks are filled with colors, I wanted  a soft and sober style of the page.  
So I chooced four tones of blue: #454D61, #567799, #7A9DB5, #AABCB which match the artworks.

### Typography:
The fonts are picked from Google Fonts library.
1. BEBAS NEUE - Is in the heading and in the logotype. 
2. Montserrat . Is in the written text in in rule-popup
3. Brittany - In the word: ART in the logotype. 
I choosed theese fonts becase they looks nice together. 

### Imagery:
All artworks are created by me and have been photographed in a studio and processed in photshop. 
All images converted to wedp.format in photoshop
The favicon is also made in photoshop- in three different sizes.

## Features
